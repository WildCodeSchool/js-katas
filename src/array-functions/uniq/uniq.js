/*
Implement a function `uniq` which takes as input a sequence and returns a sequence in which all duplicate elements following each other have been reduced to one instance.

Example:
* ['a','a','b','b','c','a','b','c'] --> ['a','b','c','a','b','c']

Don't mutate the parameter.

Bonus : do not use a loop

// TODO add your code here
