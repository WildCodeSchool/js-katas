/*
A soccer match took place between 2 teams. You are given the list of goals scored in a table of numbers: each number represents a goal of one of the teams:
- 1 for a team 1 goal
- 2 for a team 2 goal

Create a function `getScore` which returns the string of the current scores and the winning team.
Example:
* points: [1, 1, 1], result: "3-0: team 1 wins the game"
* points: [2, 1, 2, 2], result: "1-3: team 2 wins the game"
* points: [1, 2, 1, 2], result: "2-2: draw"
* points: [], result: "0-0: draw"

If the argument is null, return "Illegal argument".

If a value of the argument is not 1 or 2, return "Illegal argument".
